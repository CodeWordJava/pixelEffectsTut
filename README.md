# pixelEffectsTut
working repo for pixelEffects in JS and HTML

A progressive exploration on vanilla javascript and arrays for image manipulation and particle creation 

## Navigation

starting with the folder ***Greyscale*** which looks at how to take images break them down into arrays of pixels and then loop throught the array to change the colour settings.

We then move to ***GreyscaleRain*** which builds up the foundation of the first folder with the introdution of x and y axis manipulation and array values to manage velocity.

the final output of this project can be viewed [here](https://youtube.com/shorts/32xf0kxRH4k)
